  - Fixed bug relating to score not being added to the UI (and by extension, highscores) correctly
  
  **Credits**
  - Art, Assets and coding - myself
  - Main Menu Text - TextMeshPro (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126)
  - Pathfinding (Unused but present in assets folder, as removing it causes all prefabs to lose their scripts, plus it might be readded at a later date, requireing its necessity) - Aron Granburg
